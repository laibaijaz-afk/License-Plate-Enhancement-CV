# License-Plate-Enhancement-CV
Image processing techniques to improve license plate clarity in challenging lighting

âœ… Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the visibility of license plates captured under low-light conditions using image processing techniques in Python. The goal is to improve readability for applications like Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR).

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
License plates in low-light conditions often appear dark, low-contrast, and unreadable, making recognition difficult for automated systems. This project applies Histogram Equalization and Grey Level Slicing to enhance such images.

ðŸ›  Techniques Used
Histogram Equalization
Improves global contrast by redistributing intensity values.
Grey Level Slicing (Point Processing)
Highlights a specific intensity range to isolate license plate characters.
Combination of Techniques
Histogram Equalization â†’ Grey Level Slicing for best results.
